# AL Blog

This is the source of the blog [BC Internals](https://www.bcinternals.com).

Currently uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator as webserver and renderer.
The sites theme is [Anubis](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-anubis/) and finally it is hosted on [render](https://render.com/) which deploys directly from this repo's main branch.


As pointed out [here](https://bcinternals.com/posts/about/) the point of the blog is to demystify AL and its runtime.
